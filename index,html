        <h2>About:</h2>

        <p>
          Houjotown exists mainly as a general portfolio site for anything I tie
          to the username Houjotown. General programming projects, games, etc.
          Houjotown also exists as an introduction and experimentation site for
          my own webdev, and as such will routinely undergo maintenance and
          shifts in looks. Houjotown also exists for anything else I may feel
          interested in posting, but what that is remains unclear to me as of
          right now.
        </p>
